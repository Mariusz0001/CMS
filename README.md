## General info
Hi!<br>
I have been working at this project since two month at free time. This ASP.NET project was created to learn about new features of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/). <br>
I chosen subject of car parts to work with real items, problems an easier-to-imagine website. Also I can change subject on another for example clothes. <br>
I tried to use Enity Framework with PostgreSQL and my feelings is to never do this again. <br>
I will stop working on this project because using PostgreSQL is inconvenient and causes a lot of errors.

### Comparison with the use of PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Express in ASP.NET technology.
| |PostgreSQL |MicrosofSQL Express |
|--|---------|-------|
| *License* | Free and open source| SQL Server Express may only be used at no charge for development and testing, as well as for “micro workloads” such as mobile or web apps with minimal relational database requirements. The free license does not apply to instances running on virtual machines.|
| *Entity Framework procedures and functions* | Impossible to import stored procedures or functions by Entity | Possible to import stored procedures or functions by EntityFramework|
| *Entity Framework installation* | A lot of issues with install and connect  | Simple and easy install EntityFramework |
| *Entity Framework diagrams* | Can’t create diagram of tables in EntityFramework “The Entity Data Model Designer is unable to display the file you requested. You can edit the model using the XML Editor”| Created diagram with tables and relations in EntityFramework
| *Tools for DB management* | pgAdmin opening in web browser and has limitation of queries in new window. Inconvinient interface. | Microsoft SQL Management Studio advanced tool and user friendly interface |
